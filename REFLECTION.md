#1.  What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?
     I practiced a lot on the methods .filter, .map, and .reduce.  I feel much more comfortable with them, and I can see how a function inside another function works. I think high order functions replace loops, and make code more concise. The .reduce collapses an array into a single number, and .filter thins out based on a test or criteria, They are simply helpful for understanding data.

#.2  What was the most confusing part?
     The most confusing part was the syntax of uniqueHobbies() with `[...new Set(names)]`.  Set is a built-in JavaScript object which makes each output unique, and the spread operator (...) converts Set back into a standard array. Even though I found a lot of information at MDN there were lots of questions I had about making a suggestion. The function I suggested getEntriesBy filters by key/value pair which was slightly difficult for me. With this method I don''t need to separate countMood and longSessions functions, one function handles both, which was a bit confusing.  But overall this was an excellent experience that I liked very much.
