#1. What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code? 
     I practiced a lot on the methods .filter,  .map, and .reduce. I feel much more comfortable with them, and I can see how a function inside another function works.  I think higher order functions replace loops, and make code more concise. The .reduce collapses an array into a single number, and .filter thins out based on a test or criteria.  They are simply helpful for understanding data.

#.2 What was the most confusing part? 
     The most confusing part was the syntax of uniqueHobbies() with [...new Set(names)]. Set is a built-in JavaScript object that makes each output unique, and the spread operator (...) converts Set back into a standard array. Even though I found a lot of information at MDN (Mozilla Developers) there were lots of questions I had about making a suggestion. The function I suggested getEntriesBy() filters by key/value pair which was slightly difficult for me.  With this method I don't need to separate the countMood and longSessions functions, because one function handles both, which was a bit confusing. But overall this was an excellent experience that I liked.
